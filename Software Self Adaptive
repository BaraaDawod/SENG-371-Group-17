Software Self Adaption
SENG 371 Group 17 



Online Payments:
-	Since the system allows users to set up automatic payments for things like bills, the self adaptive system will prompt users to use the automatic payments if it sees recurring payments. For example, if a user pays rent on the first of every month the system will prompt the user after the third transaction. 
-	Recommend budgets
-	Analyze transaction history to spot irregular activity and report them to the user to disrupt potential security threats.
-	Analyze transaction history and provide statistics. (Similar to Spotify wrapped, to provide the user with insight on spending patterns, etc.)
